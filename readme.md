# TicTacToe - simple game made with python/Tkinter

- Functionally allows:
  - playing TTC with 2 players mode
  - playing TTC with 1 player mode
  - saving graphical history of played games


# TODO/REDO
Second project/script made, same problem with not using OOP.
Working as intended but not UnitTested as it should, 
if I ever revision better rebuild/change most of it.
